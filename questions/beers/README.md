# Beer Sales
Due to their poor speaking ability, patrons at Camden Yards tend to under-pay and over-pay for their beverages. We need to build an app that managers at Camden Yards can use to find all of these patrons, and for those who under-paid, ask for more money!

## Assignment
Write a program that takes in a the price of beer, then a list of patron names, number of beers, and the amount they paid. Your program should output a list of who needs to be tracked down for more money.

### Sample Input

```
BEER 1.99
Glenn 5 8.95
Schwerin 1 1.99
Glenn 5 8.95
Dave 100 5
Schwerin 2 5.97
```

### Sample Output

```
Dave owes 194.0
Glenn owes 2.0
```
